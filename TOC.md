# LLMOps Workshop

Welcome to the LLMOps workshop! This course will guide you through building, evaluating, monitoring, and deploying Large Language Model solutions efficiently using Azure AI, Azure Machine Learning Prompt Flow, Content Safety, and Azure OpenAI. Let's master LLMOps together!

## Table of Contents

The workshop is composed of the lessons below. They are sorted by coding levels: **no-code** for beginners, **low-code** for intermediates, and **full-code** for advanced learners, indicating the coding effort needed. 

Each lesson includes an **estimated time** that covers both the conceptual part and the execution of the labs. Please note that this is an estimate to assist with time planning and **may vary** slightly depending on the case.
